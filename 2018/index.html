        <p>
          The smart cities movement defines a sea change in the way we will live in cities and the way they will function in the 21st century and beyond. Cities are becoming computable and automated at every level of their operation and there is a massive disconnect emerging between their physical form and social process. No one knows where this transition from a world based on energy to one based on information, will end up or when the recent wave of change in economic structure that appeared with the ‘big bang’ and massive deregulation in the 1980s culminating in the great recession, will work itself out. In this talk, I will sketch the waves that have dominated technological change during the last 250 years, drawing on ideas suggested by Kondratieff and Schumpeter but beginning by focussing on the current wave – the so-called Fifth Kondratieff – which is dominated by the internet.
          <br><br>
          This however is ending and a sixth wave which I call the Age of the Smart City is beginning to encapsulate and underpin everything we do in ways that were first envisaged by the earliest advocates of the universal machine such as Alan Turing and Vannevar Bush. I will sketch the transition showing how new technologies are being integrated with one another, how the reliance on generating and extracting data, thence information, about the city is changing the way we understand our own spatial behaviours, and how the functions of the future city will be increasingly disconnected from its form.

          Living organisms (both photosynthetic and heterotrophic) are able to generate electrical current that can be harvested by a suitable electrochemical setup. This forms the basis of Bio Electrochemical Systems (BESs). The current output obtained from these systems has increased substantially over the last few years, with the maximum reported being in the region of ~4A m-2 and ~70A m-2, for the systems operated with photosynthetic and heterotrophic organisms receptively. Bio Electrochemical Systems could constitute a powerful educational tool for disseminating knowledge related with energy and sustainability in schools. As well as being an attractive tool for teaching, these devices may be useful source of electricity in, for example, off-grid locations. In my talk I will also discuss the use of BESs to power camera trap in the Peruvian tropical forest and to run environmental sensor for wastewater monitoring in South India.

<p>
9 undergraduate students from the University of Cambridge will be giving accessible talks on something they're passionate about.<br>

            Much ado about Nanog' - uniting stem cells and epigenetics
          </i>
          <p>
            Epigenetics and stem cells are two fields in Biology that are revolutionizing medical treatments which will affect all of us in some way. The basis of this talk will introduce the concept of stem cells; what they are, how they can be used in regenerative medicine and their connection with epigenetics. Epigenetics accounts for differences between identical individuals, tissues and cells which are not due to differences in the genetic code. I spent my summer researching at the Babraham Institute working with mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), studying the role of one protein, Nanog, to the epigenetic state. Nanog is one of a group of proteins that keep stem cells in their ‘stem cell state’ – the so-called pluripotency network. Much is currently known about Nanog in regards with its function as a transcription factor (basically its role in regulating the expression of other proteins) to maintain the stem cell state, however we are only beginning to understand its additional roles in regulating epigenetics. This talk really is ‘Much ado about Nanog’.

                 Cold atomic Physics, Quantum Physics and links with optics
               </i>
               <p>
                 "Cold atoms" is an understatement: Physicists now routinely cool gases down to within microkelvins of absolute zero. But why bother doing this? And how is it done? To actually use cold atoms we need to trap them - but trapping atoms excites them. I will discuss these issues, and focus on how a remarkable analogy between diffraction of light and the process of trapping atoms can help overcome these technical difficulties. Research often goes - almost by definition - in somewhat unexpected directions, and I will explain how what seemed like a very mundane practical problem led to some highly illuminating Physics. For all its mathematical abstraction, much of Quantum Physics - by far the most accurate theory of science - is just waves interfering with each other, and I will demonstrate this intuitive approach, showing how complex Mathematics can be understood using simple diagrams.

                 Theoretical chemistry, Application of Machine Learning in Science
               </i>
               <p>
                 Almost 100 years after the equations of quantum mechanics were formulated we are still facing the problem that it is essentially impossible to solve them for systems of more than a few particles. To carry out molecular simulations there are approximations, such as density functional theory, that are acceptably accurate in many (but not all!) cases,  but still incur a substantial computational cost. In my talk I will describe a promising approach to this general problem, based on machine learning: the potential energy surface (force field) is fitted using nonparametric models and large data sets accurately calculated on small systems. Then these fast interpolators are used to do the dynamical simulations with close to quantum accuracy at much lower cost.

                 Emotion processing in native and non-native languages
               </i>
               <p>
                 Why is swearing easier in a second language, but more satisfying in our first language? Does our brain process naughty words differently depending on the language we're speaking? I wish to provide an overview of studies from various disciplines which seek to give an answer to these questions, i.e. looking at how emotionally charged words and sentences are processed and how our reactions manifest in our native and non-native languages. From self-reports, to skin conductance and electroencephalography, I would like to introduce this field of research which covers areas of linguistics, psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and more. Mentioning some interesting examples and possibly some of my own research, I would like to introduce the two main ideas in the literature: (1) that the first, native language is always the closest to one's heart, which will produce the most intense emotional reactions, and (2) that emotional response often varies on the basis of a number of autobiographical factors, such as which languages a given speaker uses in which domains of life (family, work, etc).

               <i>
                 Probing the role of neurogranin in learning and memory by computational modelling
               </i>
               <p>
                 What’s the molecular basis for the formation of new memories? Long-term potentiation and long-term depression - the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of interactions between synapses - in the hippocampus are key process underlying learning and memory. Both occur in response to prolonged calcium stimuli in dendritic spines, which demands the question of how the same stimulus can activate two such polar responses.

                 Calcium activates these responses by binding to the signalling protein calmodulin, which can activate various downstream target proteins. It has been shown both experimentally and computationally that different frequencies of calcium stimuli activate different responses; in other words, calmodulin can act as a frequency sensor. It is also known that neurogranin, a small calmodulin-binding protein implicated in age-related neurodegeneration, has a role in modulating calmodulin’s activity, but its mode of action is poorly understood.

                 Here we applied a kinetic model of calcium signalling through calmodulin, and the subsequent activation of long-term potentiation and long-term depression, to probe the role of neurogranin. Understanding its mechanism may help us to underpin its role in neurodegenerative disorders.

                 Air Pollution in Cambridge using a Low-Cost Sensor Network
               </i>
               <p>
                 Air pollution is a global killer. Through its influence on various illnesses, it accounted for 6.4 million deaths in 2015. That’s 11% of all deaths, twice as many as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. Most of our knowledge of air pollution has been inferred using data from large, expensive reference instruments, but their expense prohibits large numbers of them in our cities. While low-cost sensors provide less accurate data than reference instruments, their sensitivities are improving and their deployment in networks gives large spatial densities of data. One of these networks is dispersed throughout Cambridge and has been capturing data on various pollutants since the summer of 2016. In my talk I will provide a snapshot of how high-resolution studies using these sensor networks can radically improve our knowledge of air pollution distribution, allowing attribution of pollution to sources. This provides tantalising prospects for air pollution policy in the future Smart Cities of our world.

               <i>
                 Developing a method to quantify tumour response to treatment using hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance imaging
               </i>
               <p>
                 The need for rapid assessment of tumor response to treatment in order to support optimal outcome has been growing in the last few years.  An emerging technique in magnetic resonance imaging follows the metabolism of pyruvate to lactate in tumours with dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP), which can increase the signal up to 10’000fold, thus enabling real time observation of metabolism in vivo. I looked at the distribution of metabolic activity in the tumour by 3D imaging; requiring high spatial resolution lowers signal-to-noise ratios and hence current fitting techniques had to be adjusted accordingly, to remove bias inherent to the Rician distribution of the MRI signal. In my talk I will describe these methods, as well as discuss two approaches (Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo and area-under-curve) for analysing the data.

                 Machine Learning for Mandarin Tone Classification
               </i>
               <p>
                 Anyone who has tried to learn Mandarin will know that the language is difficult to pick up not only because of its unique character system, but also because the meaning of a word can change depending on the tone with which you pronounce it. We have been developing a classifier which can identify the four Mandarin tones. In this talk, we will explain the algorithms we’ve used, from the quick but reliable Support Vector Machine, to the a la mode Convolutional Neural Network, and the tools that have allowed us to build these quickly (the first version was created within 24 hours at a hackathon in Cambridge). We will also run through elements of audio signal processing in the context of this project, as well as the key revelations and pitfalls encountered thus far.

               <i>
                 Web Composites - Composite Weaving Machine
               </i>
               <p>
                 Composite materials offer a wide variety of mechanical properties, their most competitive being high strength to weight ratios. However, their manufacture can be prohibitively expensive. This is because traditionally, complex forms are layered-up by hand. Although automation is possible, currently this is very capital and space intensive. The Web Composites weaving machine is an exploration into bringing mechanised weaving to a smaller and more accessible scale. This is an initial prototype, developed by myself and my MET-colleagues; Yiannis Meniou, Elena Odysseos and Lizzie O’Leary. The talk will detail the inspiration, design and manufacture of the prototype, in addition to the possible futures and implications for such a technology.
